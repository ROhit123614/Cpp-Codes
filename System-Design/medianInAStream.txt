PROBLEM: Median of 1e9 doubles from 1000 Machines
Think of: Space Req, Time Complexity and Newtork Calls
-> Simple Merge Sort-> Not Acceptable, since merging to One machine will take a lot of newtork calls
-> Use Binary Search => logN 100*(1000 Reads/Calls) 1 call per machine
-> Approximate algo: Divide the median into blocks [total 1e7 blocks],
    get an approximation of the range in which the median might lie(If distribution is equal)
    Then in About 1000*2 calls I can get the median and, very fast
