 * First, what is a sub tree of a tree? Its a subset of nodes of original tree 
 * such that this subset is connected. Note a sub tree is different from definition of subtree when recursion is performed in a tree.
 * 
 * Always think by rooting the tree. So, say that tree is rooted at node 1. 
 * At this moment, I define S(V) as the subtree rooted at node V. 
 * This subtree definition is different from the one in problem. In S(V) all nodes in subtree of V are included.
